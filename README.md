## Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
NMF is a python program that applies different nonnegative matrix factorization algorithms for clustering.  
Currently, this program supports
  * Multiplicative Updates (MU)
  * Alternating Least Squares (ALS)
  * Alternating Nonnegative Least Squares with Active Set (ANLS - AS)

### How to Run
In main.py, set desired values to variables.
